# ProxyFlow - Future Improvements

## Proxy Protocol Support

### SOCKS5 Support
Currently only HTTP CONNECT proxies are supported. Add SOCKS5 protocol support:

- [ ] Add `scheme` field usage in Gateway
  - Currently `scheme` field exists in ProxyPool model (0=socks5, 1=http) but not used
  - Gateway should check scheme and handle accordingly
- [ ] Implement SOCKS5 connection logic in Gateway
  - Different handshake protocol than HTTP CONNECT
  - Support SOCKS5 authentication
- [ ] Update add_proxy.py to accept scheme parameter
- [ ] Add scheme selector in Django admin

### Proxy Scheme Architecture
Current ProxyPool has:
- `ip_address`: Proxy IP or hostname
- `port`: Proxy port
- `proxy_username`: Auth username for original proxy
- `proxy_password`: Auth password for original proxy
- `scheme`: 0=socks5, 1=http (exists but not used)

Gateway needs to construct proper connection based on scheme:
- **HTTP CONNECT**: `CONNECT target HTTP/1.1` + `Proxy-Authorization: Basic base64(user:pass)`
- **SOCKS5**: Binary protocol handshake with auth

Example original proxy URL would be:
```
http://orig_username:hardpass@45.141.12.173:1083
socks5://orig_username:hardpass@45.141.12.173:1080
```

## Authentication Improvements

### Self-hosted Proxy Pool
Future consideration: Host own Squid proxy pool without authentication requirement
- [ ] Deploy Squid instances without auth
- [ ] Or keep auth but manage internally
- [ ] Reduces complexity of proxy credentials management

## Performance & Scaling

- [ ] Connection pooling to original proxies
- [ ] Load balancing across multiple proxies for same user
- [ ] Metrics and monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana)
- [ ] Rate limiting per user
- [ ] DDoS protection

## Security

- [ ] TLS/SSL support for Gateway (HTTPS proxy)
- [ ] IP whitelisting per user
- [ ] Audit logging of all proxy requests
- [ ] Credential rotation for original proxies

## User Experience

- [ ] Real-time bandwidth usage display
- [ ] Proxy health monitoring (uptime, latency)
- [ ] One-click proxy testing from dashboard
- [ ] Proxy rotation strategies (sticky IP, rotating, etc.)
- [ ] Custom proxy naming/tagging

## DevOps

- [ ] Kubernetes deployment manifests
- [ ] Auto-scaling based on load
- [ ] Backup and disaster recovery plan
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline improvements

## Documentation

- [ ] API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
- [ ] User guide for proxy configuration
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Architecture diagrams

**Notes:**
- Items marked as "Future consideration" are not immediate priorities
- Focus on MVP stability and core functionality first
- Prioritize based on user feedback and usage patterns
